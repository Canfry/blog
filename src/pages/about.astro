          Hi, My name is Christophe Anfry, I&apos;m 39 and want to be a frontend
          developer. My background is 15 years working in hotels and
          restaurants. Then having my first child I decided that my shifts were
          not compatibles with parent lifestyle (was working during the night
          also). So I worked for the Google workspace customer service in order
          to have office and day shifts.
          <br /><br /> From there I started get interested in web development. I
          didn&apos;t know which language to learn, so I started with HTML and CSS.
          I was facinated by all the technologies and possibilities that this environement
          could procure. From there I think i&apos;ve made all the possible mistakes
          that a beginner can make (learning different languages or technologies
          at the same time, not creating any projects, tutorials hell...). <br
          /><br />
          This blog it&apos;s one of my projects to become a frontend developer (or
          full-stack if possible, who knows <span>&#128521;</span>?) While
          I&apos;m learning I share my experience with you and give you tricks I
          find along the way. It&apos;s quiet a beginner approach but when you
          start it&apos;s very easy to get stuck, lost and overwhelmed, so
          showing you what to do, what to focus on or what to learn, will give
          you a better structure and more motivation to succeed. And if you want
          more advanced features I&apos;ll always redirect you to the
          corresponding articles, videos, people to follow or we can discover it
          together.
