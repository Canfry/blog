## Intro

Hello everybody, welcome to my blog.
This is my first real full project in order to become a frontend developer. I know that starting this carrer is tricky and require a lot of dedication.
Along the way we will discuss about all the topics we're gonna find (Frameworks, GitHub, Ressources...). First, let's talk about this project.

First, I wanted to create a blog using [Nextjs](https://www.nextjs.org), but after failing so much trying to render my mardown files into HTML, I've chosen to use [Astro](https://www.astro.build).
Following Youtubers or reading articles I saw that markdown files are very popular for static site (more specifically blogs). And Astro gives a amazing build-in implementation of mardown files(.md, .mdx).

This is the best way for me, and probably for you, to check my skills and my knowledge, and get used to find the answers of my issues, doing things, creating content, and not following a tutorial. Tutorials are really good to check for specific topics, and if you follow a full tutorial (full project of several hours) make sure to follow with the documentations opened, so you can try by your own before watching the solution.

I really want to grow with your support and your feedbacks, so you can grow with me, learning new things and creating more advanced sites or apps.
I'm very excited about this challenge and this goal, I hope you too.

## Let's jump into the project

### What I use ?

#### Terminal

You will see a lot of different maners to use a terminal (the default one on your machine, IDE's integrated terminal, 3rd party terminal...). I prefer to use my default terminal because it does exactly the same thing so why I need another one. If you're not familiar with the terminal (or Command-Line-Interface or CLI), I advice you to get used to work with it, because it's a fast and useful tool. Brad Traversy has a very nice video on this topic, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwAqEzhyjtw&t=2081s).

#### Visual Studio Code

For me the best code editor on the market, maybe the most popular one. From Microsoft, this free code editor give you the possibility to work in the best condition. Very customizable and with an infinite number of extensions and settings, to let you work as you want and in the language that you want. Easy to install, easy to use and a huge community around so you will always find the help you need. Ckeck out the [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com). A lot of ressources available regarding VScode ([James Q Quick](https://www.jamesqquick.com), [codeSTACKr](https://www.codestackr.com) and much more)

#### Astro

[Astro](https://www.astro.build), an amazing framework to build faster websites. Different from the other popular SPA (Single Page Application) frameworks like Reactjs or Vuejs, with his island architecture. Everything happens on the server as much as possible, as a MPA (Multiple Page Application). I let you discover the deep explanation of these concepts, [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/mpa-vs-spa/). Want to try ? From your terminal in the folder of your choice, you just have to type:

```
npm create astro@latest
# or
yarn create astro
# or
pnpm create astro@latest
```

Then you start the application:

```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

**Congratulation!** you've just run your first Next app.

#### Taildwindcss

A wonderful and popular CSS framework. I love css and [Sass](https://www.sass-lang.com) because i like to target my tags with descriptive names (you'll have to know css before jumping into a framework), but when you try tailwind you just love it because it saves you a lot of time and at the same time you can really customize everything. I admit that it can be a mess because your HTML tags can contain so many classes, but you get used to it and it works really fine. What I love is how easy is to make your site responsive in just one line. See the exemple:

"className='text-base md:text-xl lg:text-2xl"

In this exemple the text in my main element will start with a size of base (16px) on small screen. When my screen reaches the size md: (768px) my text grow to reach xl (20px), and finally at lg: (1024px) my font-size is 2xl(24px). How easy it is !!👌. Check their [documentation](https://www.tailwindcss.com).

### What's next ?

From now on, I'll post articles on specific topics and not so general, so we can go deepper into it and be more precise.
This first article was an introduction (of course it's the title :joy:), but I hope you've found it helpfull anyway with the will to see more.
